### Coding process
Coders coded the presence of performance summary display in each study. To coders independently coded all studies and displays and then discussed differences in coding to achieve consensus and determine final codes for each sample. Coding was conducted over a period of 1 month.

### Inter-rater reliability
To assess inter-rater reliability we measured agreement on the number of PSD codes in each study using a two-way mixed, absolute, single-measures intra-class correlation (ICC) statistic. After coding was completed independently for about half of the studies agreement was in the excellent range at 92.1%.
