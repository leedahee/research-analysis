### Identification study
##### Units of analysis
The unit of analysis was the published A&F study, including a PDF document and its supplementary material
##### Coding process
Coders coded the number of performance summary display in each study. To coders independently coded all studies and displays and then discussed differences in coding to achieve consensus and determine final codes for each sample. Coding was conducted over a period of 1 month.
##### Analysis
To assess inter-rater reliability we measured agreement on the number of PSD codes in each study using a two-way mixed, absolute, single-measures intra-class correlation (ICC) statistic. After coding was completed independently for about half of the studies agreement was in the excellent range at 92.1%.


### Dimension study
##### Units of analysis
The unit of analysis is a single visualization cropped from a published study of audit and feedback. It includes title and index relevant to the image to convey a contextual information.
##### Coding process.
Each coder reviews the codebook and discusses the meaning of the code. In pilot phase, each coder independently codes 3 PSDs and compare the answers. Coders discussed differences in coding and revised the codebook until agreement on a final codebook is reached. Coders code the presence of any dimension for each PSD (0,or 1). After two raters independently coded first half of the sample, we assessed inter-rater reliability. All raters coded all displays and resolved a disagreements by discussion.
##### Analysis
To assess inter-rater reliability we measured agreement on the presence of dimension codes in each display using inter-rater reliability(IRR) statistic.
